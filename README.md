# INGRES-AI Chatbot
Hackathon: AI-driven INGRES-AI chatbot 

This project is an AI-driven chatbot designed to act as a virtual assistant for the Ministry of Jal Shakti. It empowers users to request groundwater data and visual analytics through a simple, conversational interface. The chatbot connects directly to the INGRES database to provide real-time and historical assessment results, interactive charts, and support for planners and officials across India.
